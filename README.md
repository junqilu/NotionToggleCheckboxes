# NotionUncheckBoxes
This Chrome extension unchecks all checkboxes in Notion--a very simple function that's currently lacking in Notion

# Workflow 
When a Notion page opens, a blue button will appear in the bottom right corner

Once the mouse hovers over, the button expands and displays "Uncheck All Boxes"

Once clicked, all the checkboxes on the current Notion page will be unchecked
* If you want to redo this, press `Ctrl + Z`
